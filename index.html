<h1 style="color:black;">Project Study Buddy</h1>

<p style="color:black;">
    What we're about: 

    In our project, we intend to make scheduling for homework and study habits easier, by enabling
    students with the ability to create a plan to disperse workload, in the hopes that it would break
    procrastination habits. Daniel Choi, Rayyan Darugar, Aidan Lau, Nathaniel Obodovski all collaborated
    to bring you a program focused on taking input and making classes to keep your personalized schedule
    in an accessable database of which you can alter and adjust to your needs. We've taken concepts
    that we've learned about all throughout our time spent in our AP Computer Science Principles course
    and used what we've learned about teamwork and divide + conquering workload to bring you our passion
    project Study Buddy.
