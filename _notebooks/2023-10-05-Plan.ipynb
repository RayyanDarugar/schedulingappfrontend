    "description: The idea of a Google Chrome extension that tracks skincare shopping with a timer came from the ideas of all the group members. Aidan used skincare as his project for Web Programming Basics. Rayyan and Nathan used a timer for their Web Pogramming basics. Daniel incorporated a google chrome extension for fried rice. So, after seeing all these scattered ideas, Mr Mortensen suggested that we combine them into one idea.\n",

    "As a group, we've always been people who care about how we look and how that effects our personal self image. But, we constantly get caught in a loop of scrolling and scrolling for products on Amazon until we lose track of time, and the products that we actually liked. That's why we wanted to code a Google Chrome Extension to track shopping for skincare and provide resources that make the process as easy as possible. \n",
