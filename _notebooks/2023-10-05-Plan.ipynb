    "description: The idea of a scheduling app that plans out your homework throughout the day came from the needs of the team members of our project. Procrastinating is a large issue that all of us face, so this app is intended to help guide users into completing their homeworks with breaks.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As a group, we've always been people who procrasinate and don't complete homework in time. Despite the awareness of our procrasination, we always fail to defeat it and always stay up late to finish our homework. That's why we wanted to create a scheduling app, Study Buddy, that helps you plan out your day so you can complete your homework in time and stres-free\n",
